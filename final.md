title: Final Exam - 2019
---

This is your final exam:

Select one person who skyped into our class this semester.

For that person, find a list of their scientific publications, and choose a  set of three papers. You can include the paper that we already read in class as a part of those three, or not.

Read those  papers carefully. Then WRITE a summary/review of the set of papers, focusing on the big picture - what did they do, and why? Make sure you explain how these papers all relate to one another as part of the person's research program.

Your answer must meet the following criteria:

- not super short
- include at least one REAL scientific criticism of one of the papers
- don't be entirely boring and obvious
