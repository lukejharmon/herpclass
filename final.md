title: Final Exam - 2016
---

This is your final exam:

Choose ONE of the two options below:

# Option 1:

Select one person who skyped into our class this semester.

For that person, find a list of their scientific publications, and choose a  set of three papers. You can include the paper that we already read in class as a part of those three, or not.

Read those  papers carefully. Then WRITE a summary/review of the set of papers, focusing on the big picture - what did they do, and why? Make sure you explain how these papers all relate to one another as part of the person's research program.

Your answer must meet the following criteria:

- not super short
- include at least one REAL scientific criticism of one of the papers
- don't be entirely boring and obvious

# Option 2:

You have been appointed as the herpetological conservation manager of an area of your choice. You choose the area - but, for example, you could choose Idaho, Costa Rica, Yellowstone National Park - something at that scale.

Write a herp conservation plan for your five-year term on the job. Assume you have staff (just tell me about them) and a budget of $200,000 per year to spend.

Make sure your plan includes (as a minimum) three distinct conservation goals and specific plans on how to achieve them.

Your answer must meet the following criteria:

- not super short
- don't be entirely boring and obvious

# Due date

Please email your answer to me in a reasonable format. I prefer to get your answers by Dec 14 but the 15th is ok too.
