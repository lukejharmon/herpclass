For this week, please write a one-paragraph critique of the paper. This should focus on what you see as the weakest point in the paper. Your answer should share the best features of a useful critique:

- You present the work you are critiquing accurately and completely
- You fully justify your criticism of that work
- You present an approach or solution that you think would make the work better

For example (purely hypothetical!):

As a part of Harmon et al. 2015, the authors measured lizards and compared their body shapes across populations. The paper found significant differences across these populations, and claimed that the differences were evidence for speciation in progress. However, all of the measurements they made for one population were on juvenile lizards. This fact alone could potentially explain the differences that they found among populations. I think that this paper would have been better if they had only included measurements of adults in all of their populations.
