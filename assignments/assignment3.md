title: Assignment 3

For this week's assignment, I want you to create a bulleted list of each step of the methods of this paper. For each step, include the following three pieces of information:

- what is the method that the authors used?
- how does this method work?
- why did they use this particular method?

For example, the first method might be:

- tissue collection
- the authors collected muscle or liver tissues from around 30 individuals from 13 species of snakes, focusing on the Chihuahuan and Sonoran deserts.
- they collected tissue samples because they wanted to analyse genetic variation across these snake species. Liver and muscle tissues are good to use for collecting genetic samples.
