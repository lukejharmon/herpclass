### Alternative assignment

A few students have asked what to do if they are missing a Friday skype session because of an excused absence. So, here is your alternative assignment.

Read the paper that we are discussing that week carefully. Write a one-page summary of the main points of the paper, covering the following:

- What did the researchers do?
- What were their main findings?
- Why is this interesting / important?
- What are some remaining unanswered questions that you have?

Email me this assignment within a couple days to get credit for missing the skype.
