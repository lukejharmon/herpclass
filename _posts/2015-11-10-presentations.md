### Presentation instructions

When I grade your presentations, I will be looking for the following components:

- Summary of previous scientific research on this topic and the species that you focus on.

<i>Your project could involve a single species (like the rubber boa), a community of species (e.g. all reptiles and amphibians in central Idaho), or a clade of related species (e.g. Ranidae) - whatever is most relevant to answer the question you want to answer!</i>


- A question that is unsolved that you'd like to answer.


- An outline of the research you're planning to do. Be specific, and include detailed descriptions of your methods, a specific timeline, and hypotheses that you will be testing.  This research can take place anywhere in the world.


- Your proposed budget. Should be detailed.

<i> Make stuff up if you need to, and don't pay yourselves salary.

- Presentation style.

Please do not be boring.
