Write up answers to these questions for your final. Email your final to me by Wed Dec 16. Make sure your answers are neither too short nor too long.

1. What do you think are the top three threats to herp persistence? For each of these three threats, explain the implications of the threat and provide a potential solution.

3. Explain the controversy in herpetology regarding the evolution of oviparity and viviparity. Summarize the arguments on both sides, using Pyron and Burbank (2015) that we read in class but also other references as needed ( [hint](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jez.b.v324.6/issuetoc), start with Blackburn).

3. Choose a scientist that we had Skype into the class or come visit. Focusing on that scientistâ€™s work, choose three papers that relate to one another in some way. Write a short summary of these three papers. Your summary should describe in detail the main methods and findings of the three papers, and write an introduction and conclusion that combine the results of all three. Include full citations so that I can find the papers that you are writing about, and stick to the primary literature.
