Internet resources:
   Course website: lukejharmon.github.io/herpclass. This page has my lecture notes as pdf files, and posted assignments and quizzes.
   Tree of life (http://tolweb.org/tree/) summarizes the evolutionary relationships among living things, and includes a large section on amphibians and reptiles. A more up-to-date view can be seen using OneZoom (http://www.onezoom.org/tetrapods.htm).
   AmphibiaWeb (http://amphibiaweb.org/) and Amphibian Species of the World (http://research.amnh.org/herpetology/amphibia/index.php) have species accounts for all known species of amphibians.  The Reptile Database (http://www.reptiliaweb.org/) is the equivalent for reptiles.
   Idaho-specific information can be found at the Digital Atlas of Idaho (http://imnh.isu.edu/digitalatlas/).
   On my lab website (Harmon Lab, lukejharmon.github.io), you can find some information about my research.

Course objectives:
This course has three goals.  First, I want to introduce you to the diversity of reptiles and amphibians around the world, and their evolutionary history.  Second, I believe that classes like this introduce students to integrative biology.  This is an approach to doing science where one tries to integrate as much information as possible to understand an organism and its relationship to the environment. This requires the combination of scientific information from evolution, ecology, physiology, behavior, genetics, and other fields; we will try to weave all of these things together to understand the interactions between species and their natural environment. Finally, I hope this class provides you an entry point into the scientific literature of herpetology. At this point in your education it is time to stop reading about science, and time to start reading scientific research!

Plagiarism:
Your exams are expected to reflect your own work, and plagiarism will not be tolerated.  There can be absolutely no copying during exams.  On some assignments, you can work as a group, but it is not OK to copy another student’s work and turn it in as your own.

Make-up Policy:
I will schedule a make-up for exams and class presentations only if notified in advance.  University policy prohibits students from taking the final exam at any time other than the regularly scheduled time.

Late assignments:
See schedule above and lab schedule for assignment due dates. Ten percent will be deducted for every day late.
