title: Final Exam - 2016
---

This is your final exam:

Select one person who skyped into our class this semester.

For that person, find a list of their scientific publications, and choose a small set of papers - maybe three, although you might do two if one is long, or four if that makes sense.

Read those  papers carefully. Then WRITE a summary of the set of papers, focusing on the big picture - what did they do, and why? Make sure you explain how these papers all relate to one another as part of the person's research program.

Please email your answer to me in a reasonable format. I prefer to get your answers by Dec 14 but the 15th is ok too.
